# SHE - A Programming Language

SHE is a programming language that provides a simplified syntax for performing arithmetic operations, storing values in variables, conditional statements, looping, functions, strings, lists, and more.

## Running the Program

To run the SHE program, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have all the files.
3. Run the following command in the terminal:

```
python3 shell.py
```

## Basics

SHE supports direct arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It also supports raising a number to a power.

## Storing Values in Variables

You can store values in variables using the `VAR` keyword.

## Comparison

SHE supports comparison operations to evaluate expressions and return boolean values.

## Conditional Statements

You can use conditional statements (`IF`, `ELIF`, `ELSE`) to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions.

## Looping

SHE provides looping constructs like `FOR` and `WHILE` to repeat a block of code.

## Functions

You can define and call functions in SHE to perform specific tasks. Functions can also be assigned to variables.

## Strings

SHE supports working with strings, including concatenation and repetition.

## Lists

SHE allows you to work with lists, perform operations like concatenation and indexing, and use built-in functions for manipulating lists.

## Inbuilt Functions

SHE provides various inbuilt functions for mathematical operations, printing, input, clearing the screen, and type checking.

## Multiline Statements

SHE supports multiline statements, allowing you to execute multiple statements on the same line.

## Break and Continue

SHE supports `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` statements for controlling loop execution.

## Running Files

You can run SHE files using the `RUN` function.
